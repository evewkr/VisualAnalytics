    "text": "Create Age-Sex Pyramid visualisation to support analysis of demographic distribution across Planning Areas. A Trellis display should be used to display nine selected planning areas within one view. Yay test (Time to Test) ## Key Analysis\n\nIn June 2022, there are 4.08 million Singapore residents living in 41 Planning Areas.\nThe gender distribution is approx 51% (female), 49% (male). 19.3% of the city’s residents are aged below 20, whilst 31.1% of its residents are aged 55 and above.\nPlanning Areas (PA) Bedok, Tampines, Jurong West, Sengkang and Woodlands have the highest number of residents. Each PA houses at least 250,000 people.\nConversely, if the analysis is narrowed to focus on residents aged 60 and above, we observe that the most populated areas for this group is Bedok, Tampines, Hougang, Jurong West, Ang Mo Kio.\nThe table below shows the difference in Age-Sex distribution between the 5 most populous Planning Areas amongst residents aged 60 and above. \nBy visual analysis, we observe that some areas (i.e Tampines, Hougang) have a lesser proportion of adults aged between 35 to 55 living in these Planning Areas.\nThis is juxtaposed against areas like Bedok and Jurong West, where the area population appears to be supported by adults aged between 25 to 65.\nAng Mo Kio, unlike the other areas, appears to be “bottom-heavy”, indicating a stronger proportion of elderlies living in the area. Based on the data available, we know that most of these elderlies are living in 3-room and 4-room HDB flat. We can hypothesize that some of these elderlies may be living alone and may require societial support."

    "text": "Overview\nThe goal of this assignment is to uncover how changes in the global economical and political dynamics, in lieu of COVID-19, has impacted Singapore’s bilateral trade. For the purpose of this study, we used the data “Merchandise Trade by Region/Market” from Department of Statistics, available here\n\n\nData Wrangling\nThe following steps were required for Data Wrangling;\n\nNarrow the scope of study to Covid-related period: 2020 to 2022, plus 2019 for comparison purpose\nAlign the trade value to be based in “Million Dollars” for simple comparison\nCreate a separate document with merged values (by Trade Partner) in Import and Export\n\n\n\nAnimated overview of top trading partners\nFor the scope of this study, we want to observe any changes in trade dynamic between Singapore and its Top 10 Export Partners pre-covid (i.e. in 2019) and Top 10 Import Partners.\nSingapore’s Top Export Partners in 2019 are:\n\n\n [1] \"Mainland China ()\"                 \"Hong Kong ()\"                     \n [3] \"Malaysia ()\"                       \"United States ()\"                 \n [5] \"Indonesia ()\"                      \"Japan ()\"                         \n [7] \"Taiwan ()\"                         \"Thailand ()\"                      \n [9] \"Republic Of Korea ()\"              \"Vietnam, Socialist Republic Of ()\"\n\n\nSingapore’s Top Import Partners in 2019 are:\n\n\n [1] \"Mainland China ()\"               \"United States ()\"               \n [3] \"Malaysia ()\"                     \"Taiwan ()\"                      \n [5] \"Japan ()\"                        \"Indonesia ()\"                   \n [7] \"Republic Of Korea ()\"            \"France ()\"                      \n [9] \"United Arab Emirates ()\"         \"Germany, Federal Republic Of ()\"\n\n\nQuick Fact:\n“A nation’s net exports are the value of its total exports minus the value of its total imports.” - Investopedia\nChart 1 below showcase the Net Export for shortlisted partners above.\nThe following steps were required for further Data Wrangling;\n\nCreated a calculated column for Net Export\nRetain only the Top 10 Import Partners and Top Export Partners\n\n\nKey observations from this table:\n\nSingapore’s top net trading partner is Hong Kong, and our bottom net trading partner in Taiwan. This remained consistent across the years pre- and post- pandemic (i.e. 2019 to 2022).\nWe observe changes in trade dynamics with the following partners during the pandemic:\n\nMainland China\nRepublic of Korea\nUnited States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComprehensive view of volume between 2020 - 2022, by trading partner\nThe trellis plot below provides details of trade volume between Singapore and Individual top and bottom Net Export Trade Partners, This chart is powerful as it enables us to view trends - across time - in a singular view. The mouse-over (hover) function also provides users with details on exact value transacted.\nThe following steps were required for further Data Wrangling;\n\nPivot_longer on earlier dataframes to create columns for Dates and Trade Type (Import or Export)\nData wrangling on date format using stringr package\nEnsure that variable to identify country (Data Series in this project) is a factor which can be identified for trellis plot\n\n\nKey observations from this table:\n\nOur top trading partners are:\n\nHong Kong\nTaiwan\nUnited States\nIndonesia\n\nMonthly trade (either Import or Export) exceeding the value of SGD 2B is observed to be higher than other trading partners.\nExports to several countries (Indonesia, Taiwan) increased gradually during the pandemic. For example, exports to Indonesia grew steadily from 1.7B SGD in May-2020 to 5.3B SGD in July 2022.\nSoftening of trade between Singapore and its top partners (aside from Hong Kong) was observed, beginning Q3 last year."
